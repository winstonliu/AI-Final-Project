CSC384 Final Project Monte Carlo Reversi
Wesley Heung - c5heungw
Chengzhi Winston Liu - c5liuche

Using Python 3.

The different algorithms are contained in their respective .py files in the 'main' package.
Reversi is implemented in main/reversi.py
'find_runtime.py' is the timing function, all statistics were collected with this tool. Refer to this function for examples on how to run code.

Example execution of algorithms (executing from main directory):
~\> python3 -m main.alpha_beta
~\> python3 -m main.minimax
~\> python3 -m main.monte_carlo

Example execution of find_runtime:
~\> python3 -m find_runtime.py
